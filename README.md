## Introduction

Frequenz Channels is a *channels* implementation for Python.

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_(programming)):

> A channel is a model for interprocess communication and synchronization via
> message passing. A message may be sent over a channel, and another process or
> thread is able to receive messages sent over a channel it has a reference to,
> as a stream. Different implementations of channels may be buffered or not,
> and either synchronous or asynchronous.

Frequenz Channels are mostly designed after [Go
channels](https://tour.golang.org/concurrency/2) but it also borrows ideas from
[Rust channels](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch16-02-message-passing.html).
