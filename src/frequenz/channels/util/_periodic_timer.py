    be returned on each tick).

    The reset happens only if the delay is larger than `delay_tolerance`.

class PeriodicTimer(Receiver[timedelta]):
    """A periodic timer receiver that triggers every `interval` time.

    The message it produces is a `timedelta` containing the drift of the timer,
    i.e. the difference between when the timer should have triggered and the time
    when it actually triggered.

    This drift will likely never be `0`, because if there is a task that is
    running when it should trigger, the timer will be delayed. In this case the
    drift will be positive. A negative drift should be technically impossible,
    as the timer uses `asyncio`s loop monotonic clock.

    If the timer is delayed too much (see `delay_tolerance`), then the timer
    will behave according to the `missed_tick_behavior`. Missing ticks might
    or might not trigger a message and the drift could be accumulated or not.

    The timer accepts an optional `loop`, which will be used to track the time.
    If `loop` is `None`, then the running loop will be used (if there is no
    running loop most calls will raise a `RuntimeError`).

    Starting the timer can be delayed if necessary by using `auto_start=False`
    (for example until we have a running loop). A call to `reset()`, `ready()`,
    `receive()` or the async iterator interface to await for a new message will
    start the timer.

    Example:
        The most common use case is to just do something periodically:

        ```python
        async for drift in PeriodicTimer(timedelta(seconds=1.0)):
            print(f"The timer has triggered {drift=}")
        ```

        But you can also use [Select][frequenz.channels.util.Select] to combine
        it with other receivers, and even start it (semi) manually:

        ```python
        timer = PeriodicTimer(timedelta(seconds=1.0), auto_start=False)
        # Do some other initialization, the timer will start automatically if
        # a message is awaited (or manually via `reset()`).
        select = Select(bat_1=receiver1, timer=timer)
        while await select.ready():
            if msg := select.bat_1:
                if val := msg.inner:
                    process_data(val)
                else:
                    logging.warn("battery channel closed")
            elif drift := select.timer:
                # Print some regular battery data
                print(f"Battery is charged at {battery.soc}%")
                if stop_logging:
                    timer.stop()
                elif start_logging:
                    timer.reset()
        ```

        For timeouts it might be useful to use `MissedTickBehavior.SKIP_AND_DRIFT`
        and `delay_tolerance=timedelta(0)`, so the timer always gets
        automatically reset:

        ```python
        timer = PeriodicTimer(timedelta(seconds=1.0),
            auto_start=False,
            missed_tick_behavior=MissedTickBehavior.SKIP_AND_DRIFT,
            delay_tolerance=timedelta(0),
        )
        select = Select(bat_1=receiver1, heavy_process=receiver2, timeout=timer)
        while await select.ready():
            if msg := select.bat_1:
                if val := msg.inner:
                    process_data(val)
                    timer.reset()
                else:
                    logging.warn("battery channel closed")
            if msg := select.heavy_process:
                if val := msg.inner:
                    do_heavy_processing(val)
                else:
                    logging.warn("processing channel closed")
            elif drift := select.timeout:
                logging.warn("No data received in time")
        ```

        In this case `do_heavy_processing` might take 2 seconds, and we don't
        want our timeout timer to trigger for the missed ticks, and want the
        next tick to be relative to the time timer was last triggered.
