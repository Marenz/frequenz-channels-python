"""A timer receiver that returns the timestamp every `interval`."""

from __future__ import annotations

import asyncio
from datetime import timedelta

from .._base_classes import Receiver
from .._exceptions import ReceiverStoppedError


class PeriodicTimer(Receiver[timedelta]):
    """A periodic timer receiver that fires every `interval` time.

    The message it produces is a `timedelta` containing the drift of the timer,
    i.e. the difference between when the timer should have fired and the time
    when it actually fired. Note that the drift will not be accumulated by the
    timer, which will be automatically adjusted so it only fires (or tries to)
    in multiples of the `interval`.

    This will not always be `0`, because if there is a task that is running when it
    should fire, the timer will be delayed. In this case the drift will be
    positive. A negative drift should be technically impossible, as the timer
    uses `asyncio`s loop monotonic clock.

    Because of this, the timer can only be started once an event loop is
    running. Starting the timer can be delayed if necessary (for example until
    we have a running loop). A call to `reset()`, `ready()`, `receive()` or the
    async iterator interface to await for a new message will start the timer.

    Example:
        The most common use case is to just do something periodically:

        ```python
        async for drift in PeriodicTimer(30.0):
            print(f"The timer has fired {drift=}")
        ```

        But you can also use [Select][frequenz.channels.util.Select] to combine
        it with other receivers, and even start it (semi) manually:

        ```python
        timer = PeriodicTimer(30.0, auto_start=False)
        # Do some other initialization, the timer will start automatically if
        # a message is awaited (or manually via `reset()`).
        select = Select(bat_1=receiver1, timer=timer)
        while await select.ready():
            if msg := select.bat_1:
                if val := msg.inner:
                    process_data(val)
                else:
                    logging.warn("battery channel closed")
            if drift := select.timer:
                # Print some regular battery data
                print(f"Battery is charged at {battery.soc}%")
                if stop_logging:
                    timer.stop()
                elif start_logging:
                    timer.reset()
        ```
