"""Channel utilities.

A module with several utilities to work with channels:

* [FileWatcher][frequenz.channels.util.FileWatcher]:
  A [receiver][frequenz.channels.Receiver] that watches for file events.

* [Merge][frequenz.channels.util.Merge]:
  A [receiver][frequenz.channels.Receiver] that merge messages coming from
  multiple receivers into a single stream.

* [MergeNamed][frequenz.channels.util.MergeNamed]:
  A [receiver][frequenz.channels.Receiver] that merge messages coming from
  multiple receivers into a single named stream, allowing to identify the
  origin of each message.

* [PeriodicTimer][frequenz.channels.util.PeriodicTimer]:
  A [receiver][frequenz.channels.Receiver] that ticks at regular intervals.

* [Select][frequenz.channels.util.Select]: A helper to select the next
  available message for each [receiver][frequenz.channels.Receiver] in a group
  of receivers.
