# Typing for select() is tricky.  We had the idea of using a declarative design for
# select, something like:
#
# ```python
# class MySelector(Selector):
#     receiver1: x.new_receiver()
#     receiver2: y.new_receiver()
#
# async for selected in MySelector:
#     if selected.receiver is receiver1:
#         # Do something with selected.value
#     elif selected.receiver is receiver1:
#         # Do something with selected.value
# ```
#
# This is similar to `Enum`, but `Enum` has special support in `mypy` that we can't
# have.
#
# With the current implementation, the typing could be slightly improved by using
# `TypeVarTuple`, but we are not because "transformations" are not supported yet, see:
# https://github.com/python/typing/issues/1216
#
# Also support for `TypeVarTuple` in general is still experimental (and very incomplete
# in `mypy`).
#
# With this we would also probably be able to properly type `select` and *maybe* even be
# able to leverage the exhaustiveness checking of `mypy` to make sure the selected value
# is narrowed down to the correct type to make sure all receivers are handled, with the
# help of `assert_never` as described in:
# https://docs.python.org/3.11/library/typing.html#typing.assert_never
#
# We also explored the possibility of using `match` to perform exhaustiveness checking,
# but we couldn't find a way to make it work with `match`, and `match` is not yet
# checked for exhaustiveness by `mypy` anyway, see:
# https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/13597
async def select(
    *receivers: Receiver[Any], timeout: datetime.timedelta | None = None
) -> AsyncIterator[Selected[Any]]:
    """Iterate over the values of all receivers as they receive new values.

    This function is used to iterate over the values of all receivers as they receive
    new values.  It is used in conjunction with the
    [`Selected`][frequenz.channels.util.Selected] class and the
    [`selected_from()`][frequenz.channels.util.selected_from] function to determine
    which function to determine which receiver was selected in a select operation.

    An exhaustiveness check is performed at runtime to make sure all selected receivers
    are handled in the if-chain, so you should call `selected_from()` with all the
    receivers passed to `select()` inside the select loop, even if you plan to ignore
    a value, to signal `select()` that you are purposefully ignoring the value.

    Note:
        The `select()` function is intended to be used in cases where the set of
        receivers is static and known beforehand.  If you need to dynamically add/remove
        receivers from a select loop, there are a few alternatives.  Depending on your
        use case, one or the other could work better for you:

        * Use [`Merge`][frequenz.channels.util.Merge] or
          [`MergeNamed`][frequenz.channels.util.MergeNamed]: this is useful when you
          have and unknown number of receivers of the same type that can be handled as
          a group.
        * Use tasks to manage each recever individually: this is better if there are no
          relationships between the receivers.
        * Break the `select()` loop and start a new one with the new set of receivers
          (this should be the last resort, as it has some performance implications
           because the loop needs to be restarted).

    Example:
        ```python
        from typing import assert_never

        from frequenz.channels import ReceiverStoppedError
        from frequenz.channels.util import select, selected_from, Timer

                # Beware: `selected.value` might raise an exception, you can always
                # check for exceptions with `selected.exception` first or use
                # a try-except block. You can also quickly check if the receiver was
                # stopped and let any other unexpected exceptions bubble up.
                if selected.was_stopped:
                    print("timer1 was stopped")
